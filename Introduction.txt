Overview of kafka
=================

KAFKA - Event streaming platform

What is event?
Event is nothing but the message generated by the application

Kafka is nothing but streaming those messages reliably and durably.

Primarly used to publish and subscribe stream of events.

	What is publish?
	Applications will write to kafka topic

	What is subscribe?
	External applications will subscribe to this topic to consume those stream of events.

Also it supports continuous import/export of data into other systems.

We can also configure how long we want to capture the events into kafka topics (durably and reliably)

Functionality
=============

What is functionality here?
publishing the events, subscribing the events and processing them in the continuous manner.

This functionality is provided in a 
distributed, (A kafka topic is partitioned and distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster)
highly scalable, (scale up/down depending upon the amount of events) 
elastic, (same as scalable)
fault tolerant (one of the node/broken goes down should not have any impact) and 
secure manner.

Kafka can be deployed anywhere (onpremise/cloud/vm/baremetal hardware)
